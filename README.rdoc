= Papermill 

Asset management made easy.

== Install the gem!
  
  $ sudo gem install papermill

== Try the demo!
  
  $ sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby # unless you did it already
  $ rails -m http://github.com/bbenezech/papermill/raw/master/installation-template.txt papermill-example
  $ cd papermill-example
  $ ./script/server
  Open localhost:3000 in your browser and try to create an article with assets but without title
  
== Papermill comes in 2 flavors:

=== Generic catch-all declaration

  papermill my_option_hash                              # in your papermilled assetable model
  assets_upload(:my_key, my_option_hash)          # form helper call
  @assetable.assets(:my_key)                  # data access in your view

=== Association specific declaration

  papermill :my_association, my_option_hash             # in your papermilled assetable model
  assets_upload(:my_association, my_option_hash)  # form helper call
  @assetable.my_association                             # data access in your view


In both case, you can specify a PapermillAsset subclass to use with :class_name => MyPapermillAssetSubclass in the option hash
You can have a catch-all declaration and as many specific association as you want in your model (as long as they use different keys)
It's up to you. You can use the first one only, the second only or both.

See papermill_module.rb for the complete list of options.

== Installation

=== Once you've installed the gem, generate a migration and copy a couple of static assets:

  # copy static assets and generate a migration
  $ ./script/generate papermill PapermillMigration
  $ rake db:migrate

=== Then in environment.rb:

  
  ...
  
  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    ...
    config.gem papermill
    
    # You can set options that will be available application-wide :
    module Papermill
      :thumbnail => {
        :width => 150,
        :height => 100
      },
      :aliases => {
        :big => "500x500>"
        :small => "100x100>"
      },
      :public_root => ":rails_root/public",         # already a default
      :papermill_prefix => "system/papermill"       # already a default
    end
    # see lib/papermill/papermill_module.rb
    ...
  end
    
=== In your assetable model:
  
  # You can set a catch-all papermill association : 
  papermill :class_name => MyAssetClass
  
  # or create an association for the specific :my_gallery key
  papermill :my_gallery_assets,
    :class_name => MyGalleryAsset,
    :thumbnail => {
        :width => 90,
        :height => 30
    }

=== In your layout:

  <%= papermill_stylesheet_tag %>
  <%= papermill_javascript_tag :with_jquery => "no_conflict" %>
  # you won't need :with_jquery if you have already loaded it.
  
=== In your edit form: 

  f.images_upload(:my_gallery)     # use specific papermill :my_gallery declaration
  f.assets_upload(:my_assets)      # use catch-all
  f.asset_upload(:my_other_asset)  # use catch-all
  
=== Access them with:
  
  @assetable.my_gallery_assets.each{ |image| image_tag image.url("100x100") }
  # equivalent to:
  @assetable.assets(:my_gallery_assets).each{ |image| image_tag image.url("100x100") }
  # also equivalent to:
  @assetable.assets(:conditions => {:assetable_key => 'my_gallery_assets'}).each{ |image| image_tag image.url("100x100") }
  
  
  @assetable.assets(:my_assets).each{ |asset| asset.url }
  # if your association name is singularizable, you can do smtg like : 
  @assetable.asset(:my_other_asset).try(:url)
  # equivalent to:
  @assetable.assets(:my_other_asset).first.try(:url)
