= Papermill 

* Asset management made easy, 10 minutes integration.
* All-you-can-eat glue around Polymorphic Paperclip table, SWFUpload & JQuery. 
* Associate any image or list of images with any model and any key. 

== Install the gem
  
  sudo gem install papermill
 
== Try the demo
  
  rails -m http://github.com/bbenezech/papermill/raw/master/demo.txt papermill-example

=== Out-of-the-box compatibility with : 

* Formtastic          # use :as => :[image|asset](s)_upload
* JGrowl              # for notifications (included)
* FaceBox             # for popups (included)
* Stringex            # (or any String#to_url) for asset filename/url generation

=== Navigator minimal requirements: 

* IE6+
* Flash 9+
* Javascript ON

Check your audience.

=== Server requirements:

* Rails 2.3.[4~>8]
* Paperclip 2.3.1.1 (loaded with gem dependency)
* Front web server serving static assets if present, and forwarding demand to rails if not. Any classic installation will do that by default.
* NOT compatible with Heroku/S3

== Installation

=== Once gem is installed

Generate the migration
  ./script/generate papermill_table PapermillMigration

Edit it and migrate
  rake db:migrate

Copy static assets to your public directory
  ./script/generate papermill_assets
  
Create the option file config/initializers/papermill.rb
  ./script/generate papermill_initializer
  
Go have a look at config/initializers/papermill.rb

=== In environment.rb

  ...
  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    ...
    config.gem papermill
  end

=== In your layout


==== Quick version

Inside <head></head>
  <%= papermill_stylesheet_tag %>

Before </body> (best practice for javascript loading)
  <%= papermill_javascript_tag :with_jquery => "no_conflict" %>

You don't need :with_jquery if load it by yourself. Pass "no_conflict" if you use the default Prototype library, or some other '$' library (mootools..)
  
==== In a real-world production application, you could use something like this, and adapt it to your own needs

Inside <head></head>
  <% unless @content_for_papermill_inline_js.blank? %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "/facebox/facebox.js", "/jgrowl/jquery.jgrowl_minimized.js", "/papermill/jquery.Jcrop.min.js", "/swfupload/swfupload.js", "/papermill/papermill.js", :cache => "papermill" %>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      jQuery(document).ready(function() {
        <%= yield :content_for_papermill_inline_js %>
      }
    </script>
  <% end %>

Before </body>
  <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.2/jquery-ui.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <% unless @content_for_papermill_inline_js.blank? %>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag("/facebox/facebox.css", "/jgrowl/jquery.jgrowl.css", "/Jcrop/jquery.Jcrop.css", "/papermill/papermill.css", :cache => "papermill") %>
    <style type="text/css">
      <%= yield :papermill_inline_css %>
    </style>
  <% end %>

== Security

=== URL-hacking

Maybe you don't want users to use your application as a thumbnailing farm for their own uploaded images, or you have protected members areas and you don't want users to 'browse' others members file.

* Brute solution: pass :use_url_key to true in the options (config/initializers/papermill.rb). A crypted hash unique to your application and to each asset and to the requested style will be added to the URL. No more happy-guessing of anything. Do that first before going live, or you'll have to migrate all assets...
* pass :alias_only to true. This will disable the possibility to generate thumbnails with a papermill string in the url, but won't do anything for the member area thing. Plus you will have to use aliases only, form helpers included (pass :thumbnail => { :style => :some_alias })

== Usage

Assetable is the class that has_many papermill_assets (i.e. the class with the papermill declaration)

=== Assetable declaration

You can have one :default association (his settings will be used for unfound associations) and as many other associations as you want in your model.
You can define a papermill relationship dynamically: just do smtg like Assetable.papermill(:dynamic_key, {}) when you need to. Perfect for CMS where associations are created by users. Then you'll be able to use assetable.dynamic_key to retrieve the associated assets. If you don't send the {}, default options from default association will be used, which may or may not be what you want.

Actually, the form helper leverages this when you use a :key that doesn't exist: it will create a new Papermill relationship whith :key as the name and options from the :default declaration if any found on the model.

If you don't need dynamic keys, just declare your associations in the model, like this : 

  class Article
    papermill :default
    papermill :images
    papermill :pdf_version
    papermill :cover_image
    papermill :illustrations
  end

=== Form helpers
  
Example form:
  
  form_for @assetable do 
    # I need a simple asset upload field :
    f.asset_upload  :pdf_version
    
    # Now I need to be able to upload as many documents as I need, and sort them at will
    # no document should be bigger than 1MB (respect the quoting!)
    # and I don't want the mass_edit feature
    f.assets_upload :documentation, :swfupload => { :file_size_limit => "'1 MB'" }, :mass_edit => false
 
    # I need to display *one* cover *image*, format will be 200x200
    # targetted_size will give the uploader hints when cropping the image after upload : desired display size and wanted aspect-ratio.
    # Better than cropping automatically in the center if the character's head is in the upper-left corner..
    # :thumbnail => { :width & :height } set the dimensions of the preview thumbnail
    # And finally, I need a 200x200# crop for preview, not the default 200x200> that would be generated by default ("#{:width}x#{:heigth}>")
    f.image_upload  :cover_image, :targetted_size => "200x200", :thumbnail => { :width => 200, :height => 200, :style => "200x200#" }
    
    # Now the image gallery, sortable.
    # I use :gallery => { :lines & :columns } to give the number of lines/columns, 
    # and some CSS will be generated to size the gallery perfectly, 
    # according to the thumb size inside the gallery and their padding/margin/border sizes.
    # the number of lines will increase if needed when uploading
    f.images_upload :illustrations, { 
      :thumbnail => {
        :width => 100,
        :height => 70
      },
      :gallery => {
        :columns => 8,       # number of columns
        :lines => 2,         # number of lines
        :vpadding => 2,      # vertical padding around each thumb
        :hpadding => 2,      # horizontal one
        :vmargin => 3,       # vertical margin
        :hmargin => 1,       # horizontal one 
        :border_thickness => 2 # border size around each thumb
      } 
    }
  end
  
With Formtastic, pass 
  
  :as => (:image_upload | :images_upload | :asset_upload | :assets_upload)
And add your options as you would with the normal helpers.

With FormTagHelpers, use (image_upload_tag | images_upload_tag | asset_upload_tag | assets_upload_tag) @assetable, :key, options

  image_upload_tag  @article, :cover_image, :targetted_size => "200x200"

=== Asset editing 

* double-click on any uploaded asset in any form-helper to access & edit his properties
* then double-click image to crop it if it's an image. You'll then access a Jcrop window. Pass :targetted_size => "widthxheigth" to lock aspect-ratio and default the selection size to widthxheigth.

=== Thumbnails

  
==== On-the-fly request time processing:

  PapermillAsset#url(papermill string (see 1.))  # path and url behave the same way
  PapermillAsset#url(papermill alias (see 2.))

Pros: fast. Nothing done upon page rendering. If asset isn't found by Apache/NGinx, then request is passed to rails, which will create it, once.

Cons: need to setup an alias in the options if you want to define use a hash instead of a papermill string (for custom watermark)

==== Render time processing:

  PapermillAsset#url!(papermill string (see 1.))  # path! and url! behave the same way
  PapermillAsset#url!(papermill alias (see 2.))
  PapermillAsset#url!(papermill hash (see 3.))
  
Pros: can use a hash directly in the url call.

Cons: needs a thumbnail presence check at each render.

==== 1. Papermill String

Consist of:

* an ImageMagick geometry string (ex: "100x100>", "original", "100x#", etc.)
* an optional watermark (-wm) flag  # will use option[:watemark] for URI
* an optional copyright (©) flag    # will use copyright text after the "©" or options[:copyright]

Examples:

  image_tag @article.covers.first.url("100x100")
  image_tag @article.covers.first.url("original©")
  image_tag @article.covers.first.url("100x100#-wm©")
  image_tag @article.covers.first.url("100x200#©papermill")

==== 2. Papermill Alias

Those are application-wide, set them in the options

Consist of:

  :geometry => "ImageMagick-geometry-string"
  :copyright => true | "copyright"    # If true, the asset copyright field will be used. Edit the asset.
  :watermark => true | URI            # If true, will use options[:watemark]
  
Examples:

#config/initilializers/papermill.rb

  # snip
  :aliases => {
    :thumb_copyrighted => {
      :geometry => "100x100",
      :copyright => "papermill",
    },
    :thumb_copyrighted_dynamically => {
      :geometry => "100x100",
      :copyright => true
    },
    :thumb_watermarked_with_rails => {
      :width => "100",
      :height => "100",
      :watermark => "/images/rails.png"
    }
  }
  
Then in your views, simply do

  image_tag @article.covers.first.url(:thumb_copyrighted)

==== 3. Papermill Hash

Same as aliases, but defined directly in #url!()
Plus you can add a :name that will be used for style-name (defaults to a md5 of the hash)

Example:

  image_tag @article.covers.first.url(
    :geometry => "100x100",
    :watermark => "/images/rails.png",
    :copyright => "papermill",
    :name => "thumbnail_watermarked_and_copyrighted"
  )

=== Resource access

Papermill generates an #<association_key> association

  @entry.mug_shots.first
  @entry.diaporamas.each do |image| ..
  # etc.
  
=== Using PapermillAsset

  @asset = @entry.mug_shots.first
  image_tag @asset.url              # original
  image_tag @asset.url("100x>")     # assuming asset is an image
  image_tag @asset.url(:big)        # assuming you have a :big alias
  @asset.name
  @asset.content_type
  @asset.path
  @asset.path("100x>")
  # etc.
